        <h1>Oh hey, thanks for wanting to know more about me ü§©‚úåÔ∏è</h1>
        <p>My name is Tung, but I prefer to be called Pine. I am a university student based in Hanoi, Vietnam. I am currently doing the Software Development major at Swinburne University Vietnam. Here are some interesting things about me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>My preferred name (Pine) is actually an English translation of my Vietnamese name Tung!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I am very passionate about programming. Lots of programming ideas pop up in my head but sadly I don't have the time to actualize all of them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>My main focus in programmming is web development since the web applications I create can be tested and run everywhere. However, I still like to keep an open mind and dip my toes into other areas in programming. It's fun exploring new territories :)</p>

                    I am an ardent Swiftie a.k.a. Taylor Swift fan (I guess you can call me a stan, but I don't like inciting "fanwar" with other fandoms). My favorite TS album is Evermore, though the album I want to buy most is her recently released album <em>Midnights</em>.

                    Last year I listened to Taylor Swift for more than 25,000 minutes on Spotify! Quite a lot of that listening time was dedicated to All Too Well ‚ú®(Taylor's Version)‚ú®, my all-time favorite song.

            <li>
                <p>I am currently learning Spanish. It all started with the intention of understanding <em>ROSAL√çA</em>'s <em>MOTOMAMI</em>, an album I love. Since then I have been mercilessly dragged down the Spanish rabbit hole. <strong>¬øQuieres apprender espa√±ol conmigo?</strong></p>
