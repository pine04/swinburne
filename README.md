# Swinburne Unit Repository

Contains all the labs and assignments I have done at Swinburne. Also events I have participated in. It is not meant to be complete. Projects for which I have signed NDAs are not uploaded here.

Video files are not committed because they are too large. If you want to watch my videos for reference, you can contact me by email.

Enjoy cheating :)
