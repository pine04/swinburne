# Swinburne Unit Repository

Contains all the labs and assignments I have done at Swinburne. Also events I have participated in. Not meant to be complete.

Due to their large size, videos will be uploaded to this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1of8OBSdcJHJFRH1iPv6H_Qxty6Ww7UeO?usp=drive_link) instead.
