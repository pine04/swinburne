        <h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
        <h2>by Ta Quang Tung</h2>

        <p>
            A report from <em>Animal Medicines Australia (AMA)</em> has found that many Australians took the opportunity to
            introduce
            a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a <strong>significant
                increase</strong> in
            the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird. Their research also indicated that pets had a
            number of <strong>positive influences</strong> on their lives such as:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>companionship</li>
            <li>better mental health</li>
            <li>joy and happiness</li>
        </ul>

            <button data-section="2019" class="selected">2019</button>
            <button data-section="2021" >2021</button>
            <button data-section="both" >Both</button>

        <p>
            With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to consider the needs of companion
            animals and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as accepting
            animals in public places and transport.
