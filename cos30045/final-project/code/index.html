                <h1>International student migration around the world - origins and destinations</h1>
                <p>by Ta Quang Tung, Nguyen Quang Huy</p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to greater economic prosperity and the convenience of international travel, people have
                    become more
                    mobile than before. No longer are people tied down to their country of origin - they can now travel
                    the world to
                    look for a better life in other countries. Among these migrants, many leave their homes in search of
                    better
                    educational opportunities. Between 2017 and 2021, an estimated 30 million people migrated to study
                    overseas.
                    These international students play an important cultural and socio-economic role in the places they
                    arrive at.
                    This visualization project aims to give readers an overview of international student migration by
                    looking at
                    where these students came from and where they headed.

                        China and India were the leading origin countries. Over the period, Vietnam increased in
                        ranking, going from 6 to 3. Uzbekistan and the Syrian Arab Republic saw the biggest jumps in
                        rankings out of all. In
                        addition to developing Asian and African countries, some wealthier Western countries like
                        Germany, the USA,
                        and France were also present in the ranking. Asian students generally preferred Western
                        destinations
                        (see China, India, South Korea), while European students preferred other European countries (see
                        Germany, France, Italy).

                        their rankings increased over the period. That said, the majority of students who came to these
                        Asian countries were from Asia.</p>

                    The data for this visualization project has been collected from the <a
                        href="http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx">data portal of UNESCO Institute for Statistics
                        (UIS)</a>
                    The data sets used are: <em>Inbound internationally mobile students by country of origin</em>, and
                    <em>Outbound internationally mobile students by host region</em>. This data set is not comprehensive
                    and data for certain years or countries is not available. However, for the sake of integrity, we
                    have avoided replacing missing data with data from other sources.
                </p>
                <p>We hope you have learned a thing or two from this visualization.</p>
