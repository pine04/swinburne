Style guide for Ruby in this repository for the sake of consistency:

- All method declarations and invocations must use parentheses. The only exception to this rule is the invocation of setters.  
- Methods that are intended to return a value must indicate that return value with the `return` keyword.  
- Double quotes must be used instead of single quotes.  
- Only comments that explain a potentially confusing constant/variable/method/class/module/etc. are allowed. Instruction comments must be removed.  
- Code blocks are indented with a TAB or 4 spaces.  
- Dependency libraries do not have to conform to these rules.  
- For logical operators, `&&`, `||` and `!` must be used instead of their respective keywords `and`, `or`, `not`.  
- The condition in `if`, `while`, `until`, `case` statements must be wrapped in parentheses.
