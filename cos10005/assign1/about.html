                    My full name is Ta Quang Tung, but I like to be called Pine. My father named me after a prominent
                    Vietnamese surgeon, Ton That Tung, whom he is a huge fan of. The name Tung translates into Pine (as in
                    pine tree) in English. Even though I choose the pine tree as my personal logo, which you can see placed
                    around this website, I like to interpret my name in its verb sense. The verb "to pine" means to become
                    very sad at the loss of someone, which I think reflects my emotional personality really well.

                    I was born on September 21, 2004 and have been living in Hanoi since birth. Hanoi, Vietnam's bustling
                    capital, is a city where people are constantly on the go, both physically and mentally. The city is a significant
                    cultural hub for both visitors and locals, as well as one of the nation's major economic hubs. The
                    architecture of the city represents both the past and the present, with both contemporary high-rise
                    structures and traditional districts.

                    During high school, I spent the majority of my first and second year preparing for the National English
                    Olympiad, an annual academic competition hosted for gifted students all over the country. My hard work
                    paid off and I managed to become a contestant. I emerged victorious with a second prize under my belt,
                    which is my biggest achievement so far. I still look back to this time of my life with great pride and
                    yearning. In retrospect, however, I have realized that the true prize was not the second title itself,
                    but rather a deeper understanding of my potential and the true nature of my motivation.

                    Even though my academic background leans towards language, I have a deep passion for programming. The
                    area I choose to specialize in, Software Development, strikes the perfect balance between logic and
                    creativity. I am currently taking Software Development as a first-year student at Swinburne University.
                    Here is my academic schedule. If you are also a Swinburne student, you might see me at these times!
