                <p>
                    A survey is often used in a research project to collect feedback from users of a system or participants of an event. Results of the evaluation will be of interest to the researcher(s) to help them determine whether the approach is likely to affect the objectives set in the research.

                    Participation in surveys is voluntary. You may discontinue participation at any time during the research activity and, on request, will delete data collected from you (until publication, at which point deletion is no longer possible).
